The CSG tries to put on a a soldering lecture once a year. We try to collect old hardware that has no value to use for these labs. 

If you have any old computers that you would like to donate that would be used for education, then we would be more then willing to accept. 
You can drop off your stuff at or outside LF 111A. We Thank you for your donations!
